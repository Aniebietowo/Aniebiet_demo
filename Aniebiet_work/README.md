STEPS ON HOW I WROTE MY CODE.

Using the C language, i did the following
1. I started with the Preprocessor directive #include <stdio.h>
2. followed by int main () 
3. next was the symbol {
4. next was printf(""); the i typed the hello world inside the two strings
5. After that, i created a new line my inlude \n in side the printf
6. Then i typed, return (o);
7. lastly, i closed it with a brace }
   
	After following the above steps, i printed it by pressing ESC, SHIFT plus COLON then WQ.
